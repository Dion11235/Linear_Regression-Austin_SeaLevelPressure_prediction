# Linear_Regression-Austin_SeaLevelPressure_prediction

This small project explores the weather in Austin, Texas. The dataset used here, contains 2013-2017 daily records of various weather components. 
Based on the data, A simple linear regression model has been implemented to predict the average sea-level pressure (Inches) with respect to 
average temperature (Farenheit) and average Dew-Point (Farenheit) as both are well correlated with SeaLevelPressureF variable.
